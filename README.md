Unit 15 | Assignment - Interactive Dashboard

Skills tested: JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, D3.js/Plotly.js, Flask, SQLalchemy, Bootstrap, Pandas (DataFrames)

This exercise incorporates SQLalchemy to create a connection to a SQLite database in order to query and filter data.  The data is then stored into JSON objects where it can be organized and routed depending on the user input.  There was a portion of the Flask app where Panda was used to manipulate a CSV file for names/ids.  An HTML file with a connection to the d3 library is then used to manipulate the DOM, and take in the user input from a dropdown menu.  The dropdown event then calls a function where it pulls the json object via Flask routing.  The information from the JSON object is then, Plotly is used to present the charts and info depending on user input.
